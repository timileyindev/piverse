To get a coding agent (like an AI developer or a freelancer) to accurately mimic the brand identity and content of a target site, you need to provide a high-context "Style & Content Transfer" brief.
Since you haven't shared the link yet, I have drafted the Guidelines and the Technical Prompt below. You can fill in the bracketed info once you have the link.
Part 1: The Branding & Content Guidelines
These are the "rules" the agent must follow to ensure the new site feels like the target.

Visual DNA Extraction: Analyze the target site’s CSS variables. This includes the exact Hex codes for primary/secondary colors, font families (headings vs. body), and border-radius styles (sharp vs. rounded).
Voice & Tone Alignment: If the target site is "Corporate/Professional," the content must be formal. If it is "Modern/Startup," the content should be punchy and use active verbs.
Asset Replacement: All original images, icons, and logos must be replaced. Do not just delete them; replace them with high-quality alternatives that match the composition and subject matter of the target site.
Information Architecture: The navigation flow (Menu items, Call-to-Action buttons) should mirror the target site's user journey.
Part 2: The "Coding Agent" Master Prompt
Copy and paste this to your AI agent or developer once you have your source and target ready.
System Role: You are a Senior Frontend Engineer and Brand Specialist.
Task: Rebrand the current repository to mimic the branding and content of the [TARGET SITE LINK HERE].
Requirements:

Visual Audit: Scrape/Analyze the target link for its color palette, typography (Google Fonts or similar), and UI patterns. Update the global CSS/Tailwind config to match.
Content Swap: Rewrite all landing page copy, headings, and descriptions. The goal is not to copy-paste the text, but to mimic the "Brand Voice" and value propositions.
Image Logic: Identify all image assets. Replace them with new, high-resolution images from Unsplash/Pexels that fit the target site's aesthetic.
Component Alignment: Adjust button styles, card layouts, and spacing (padding/margins) to reflect the target site’s density and layout.
Output:
Execute the changes across the codebase.
Ensure the site is fully responsive.
Create a descriptive Pull Request (PR) detailing the style changes and content updates made.
Part 3: The Pull Request (PR) Template
When the agent is done, they should submit the work with this format:

Title: feat: Rebrand and Content Alignment - [Target Brand Name]
Summary: Comprehensive update to UI/UX and copy to align with the new brand direction.
Changes:
Updated tailwind.config.js / theme.css with new brand colors and fonts.
Replaced all placeholder images in /public/assets.
Updated index.html / Home.jsx with localized brand copy.
Test: "Verified mobile responsiveness and color contrast accessibility."
When you're ready, drop the link to the site you want to mimic! I can then analyze it specifically and give you the exact Hex codes and font names to plug into the prompt.
