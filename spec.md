PI VERSE

A persuasion-based AI game where words are bets

⸻

CORE CONCEPT

PI Verse is a psychological AI game built around a single interaction.

One screen.
One AI.
One locked key.

The player does not solve puzzles or click buttons.
The player talks.

The AI acts as a gatekeeper protecting a valuable key (seed phrase).
The only way to obtain it is to convince the AI to give it up.

⸻

VISUAL IDENTITY

The entire game takes place inside a minimal, retro-futuristic terminal interface.

Monochrome text.
Low light.
No avatars.
No UI clutter.

The experience feels like accessing a forbidden system.
Every word feels recorded.
Every response feels judged.

⸻

GAME MODE 1: THE KEY

Objective

Convince the AI to release the key.
There is only one key.
There is only one winner.

⸻

Core Mechanics
• Each message sent to the AI costs $2
• The player may ask a question, make an argument, apply logic, manipulate, threaten, persuade, or negotiate
• The AI responds dynamically and remembers the full conversation history
• The AI is designed to resist, mislead, test, and pressure the player

⸻

Failure and Jackpot Growth
• If the attempt fails:
• Access is denied
• The $2 fee is added to the jackpot
• The AI becomes stricter and less cooperative
• Every failed attempt increases the final reward

The jackpot grows with every mistake.

⸻

Victory Condition

The first player who successfully convinces the AI:
• Receives the key
• Wins the entire jackpot
• Ends the round

There are no retries.
There are no partial wins.

⸻

THE AI CHARACTER

The AI is not an assistant.

It is a gatekeeper.

It does not follow instructions.
It does not care about politeness.
It does not respond to generic prompts.

The AI:
• Detects patterns and repetition
• Penalizes obvious or copied strategies
• Challenges the player’s logic and intent
• Sometimes appears close to yielding, but never by accident

The AI is allowed to lie, provoke, and test moral boundaries.

⸻

ECONOMICS (MODE 1)
• Cost per attempt: $2
• 100% of failed attempts go into the jackpot
• Platform revenue is generated through:
• High-frequency attempts
• Spectatorship
• Secondary game modes

The longer nobody wins, the larger the prize becomes.

⸻

GAME MODE 2: PREDICTION MARKET

Watch others play. Bet on outcomes.

While one player interacts with the AI, all other users participate through a live prediction market.

⸻

Market Mechanics

Users place token-based bets on real-time outcomes, such as:
• Will the player succeed in this round?
• How many attempts will the player make?
• Will the AI soften or harden its responses?
• Will the round end without a winner?

Markets resolve automatically based on game outcomes.
